# Expert / Supervisor kickoff — 2026-02-25 

## Participants
- Supervisor: Enrico Viola
- Apprentice: Tsering Lhamo Anodunkhartsang
- (Experts present / consulted): Yves Kaufmann, Mirio Joël Eggmann

## Purpose
Review the current implementation and documentation status, align expectations for the final delivery, and confirm the preparation steps for the technical presentation and oral examination.

## Topics discussed
1) **Documentation discipline**
- The work journal should include not only tasks completed, but also a short note on **what was learned** each day.
- Markdown documentation should be transferred into the A4 document earlier, rather than leaving all transfer work to the very end.

2) **Versioning and commits**
- Commits should be made regularly to preserve traceability and document meaningful progress steps.

3) **Presentation expectations**
- The presentation is aimed at a **technical audience**.
- The implementation should therefore be explained through the code, architecture, and technical decisions.
- A short live or guided demo is expected (approx. 10 minutes).

4) **Oral examination expectations**
- The oral discussion may focus on technical details, including implementation choices, code structure, and terminology.
- It is important to be prepared to explain the “nitty-gritty” technical parts clearly.

5) **Submission discipline**
- The work should be handed in on time, ideally a few hours before the official deadline to reduce risk.

6) **Planning / delivery items**
- The Sprint 2 time schedule must be submitted.
- The final presentation is planned **on site at Accenture**.
- Presence is expected on **13.03.2026 at 13:00**.

7) **Documentation draft review**
- An A4 draft of the documentation should be sent to the expert in advance for feedback.

## Decisions
- Strengthen daily documentation discipline by recording learning outcomes in the work journal.
- Prioritize earlier transfer from markdown into the formal A4 document.
- Keep the final presentation and oral preparation strongly technical.
- Submit Sprint 2 planning and final deliverables with time safety buffer.

## Open questions / risks
- Ensure the final A4 documentation is transferred and formatted early enough.
- Ensure the technical presentation is supported by clear evidence and stable demo behavior.

## Action items
- Add “What I learned” notes to daily journal entries.
- Continue committing regularly with meaningful progress checkpoints.
- Transfer finalized markdown content into the A4 document as early as possible.
- Submit Sprint 2 time schedule.
- Send an A4 draft to the expert for feedback.
- Prepare a technically focused presentation and demo for 13.03.2026.
