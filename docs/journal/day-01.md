# Day 01 — 2026-02-13

## Goal (from timeplan)
- Sprint planning + kickoff alignment
- Repo/bootstrap baseline started
- Set up documentation discipline

## Work done
- Sprint planning completed (Sprint 1 baseline scope).
- Expert/supervisor kickoff: confirmed scope/goals, constraints (Mac mini M4 / 16GB), Scrum method, and decision to maintain two timeplans (Sprint 1 + Sprint 2).
- Repository bootstrap and initial backend scaffold created.
- Identified early setup friction (git identity/auth).

## Outputs / evidence
- Meeting note: `evidence/meeting-notes/2026-02-13_expert-meeting.md`
- Code: backend scaffold commits (commit: `<hash>`)
- Initial docs created/started: A01, A02/A03 template, H01 draft (as applicable)

## Problems / deviations
- Git setup took longer than planned due to identity/auth issues (see A05 deviation log).

## Next day plan
- Continue backend baseline: /health + /v1/chat/completions skeleton
- Add contract tests and start perf script work
